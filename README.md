At the start of the game the computer will randomly select a pattern of four different
numbers from a total of 8 different numbers.

- A player will have 10 attempts to guess the number combinations

At the end of each guess, computer will provide one of the following response
as feedback:

- The player had guess a correct number
- The player had guessed a correct number and its correct location
- The playerâ€™s guess was incorrect
