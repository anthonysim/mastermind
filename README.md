## Rules

At the start of the game the computer will randomly select a pattern of four different
numbers from a total of 8 different numbers.

- A player will have 10 attempts to guess the number combinations

At the end of each guess, computer will provide one of the following response
as feedback:

- The player had guess a correct number
- The player had guessed a correct number and its correct location
- The playerâ€™s guess was incorrect

## Tech

- React (Create-React-App) / Javascript
- CSS / Sass

## Notes
The number combination is hidden, but for the sake of showcasing the
game, I console logged the hidden number combination. To see the hidden
number combination, please open your console.
