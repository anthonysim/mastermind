## Rules

At the start of the game the computer will randomly select a pattern of four different
numbers from a total of 8 different numbers.

At the end of each guess, computer will provide one of the following response
as feedback:

- The player had guess a correct number
- The player had guessed a correct number and its correct location
- The playerâ€™s guess was incorrect

## Overview

Hello and thank you for taking the time to read what I wrote. This will be a high level overview of the code structure and general implementation. If time is of the essence, please click <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NLoRm0B9ueeeHNVasq6o5gWarWf4S_Uj/view?usp=sharing">here
</a>
<span>to view a quick demo.</span>

If time permits, please view the demo prior to this overview.

The mastermind game was created using Javascript / React - all the files are inside the ```src``` folder.

- ```src/components``` folder contains all the javascript files,
- ```src/stylings``` folder contains all the css / sass files, and the
- ```utils``` folder contains all the helper functions that were created.

<br/>

The bulk of the application is inside the ```App.js``` file located inside the ```src/components``` folder. ```Lines 15 to 137``` are the state and the various onClick handlers that listen for a user's click. ```Lines 139``` till the end are what is rendered on the browser when the application is started.


When the user begins the game, they are greeted with a welcome which can be seen on ```lines 147 to 158```. When the user selects a difficulty level the ```difficultyHandler``` function on ```line 84``` is invoked. This handler determines the max number that should be retrieved (4, 7, 10) depending on the difficulty level. The ```fetchData``` function located insided the ```utils``` folder is invoked. This function uses axios to fetch data from the ```random.org``` api and returns the random number combinations. The ```difficultyHandler``` function ends with the state updated accordingly and the timer initiated.

Since the state was updated, the welcome page is not rendered  and in its place a timer, title, shapes, an input bar, and guess history is shown.

The ```Timer``` function on ```lines 104 to 136``` that was invoked at the of end of the ```difficultyHandler``` basically calls a setTimeout everything second until the time reaches zero time.

The shapes titled ```Shapes.js``` in the same ```src/components``` folder, generates the number combination that the user needs to guess represented in shapes (triangle, square, circle).

The input bar inside ```lines 168 to 183``` is where the user types in their guesses. When a user types in a guess, the ```submitHandler``` on ```line 43``` is invoked. Based on the user's guess the following messages appear:

- 'Not a number, please type in numbers!'
- 'Guess is either too short or too long!'
- 'Guess matches data!'
- 'The player had guessed a correct number and its correct location!'
- 'The player had guess a correct number!'
- 'The player's guess was incorrect!'
- 'Something went wrong!'

A quick run through, let's say a user typed in a guess '1234', the ```submitHandler``` will invoke call the ```guessCheck``` function in the ```utils``` folder which returns a number, this number is used when the ```messages``` function, also in the ```utils``` folder to return one of the messages listed above. Depending on the user's guess, state is updated accordingly.

- If the user wins, they are greeted with a Congratulations modal from ```Modal.js``` located in the ```src/components``` folder with the option to play another game.
- If the user runs out of time, this modal would state that they lost and ran out of time.
- If the uses all their guesses up, they will receive an alert stating that they don't have any other attempts left and the game ends.

## Thoughts

My initial thought was "what is mastermind?" In all honesty this must've been a game that I was never introduced in my youth. Nevertheless, I read the directions that were given to me and did my best to implement the game.

When structuring the game I went from beginning to end. I wanted a welcome page to greet the user and give them the option to select a difficulty level. From there it was all about waiting for the user to make a guess. I wrote down all the scenarios that could play out with a user.

- If a user types in a non-number?
- If a user types in a short or long guess?
- If the player guess matches?
- If the player had guessed a correct number and its correct location?
- If the player had guess a correct number?
- If the player's guess was incorrect?

And with each potential scenario I went by a step by step approach with what should happen first, second, third, and so on until the end along with conditions that may play out as well.

After I implemented everything I decided to add in a timer. Once the timer was running I made sure that it was integrated with the game (when the timer runs out the game ends).

To summarize, my general approach was to read what was given to me, based on the user's input detail all the scenarios that could play out, then code out step by step what the output should be based on the scenarios.
